Some weights of BertModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at SpanBERT/spanbert-base-cased and are newly initialized: ['bert.pooler.dense.bias', 'bert.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Using the `WAND_DISABLED` environment variable is deprecated and will be removed in v5. Use the --report_to flag to control the integrations used for logging result (for instance --report_to none).
/a/home/cc/students/cs/ranraboh/miniconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/optimization.py:306: FutureWarning: This implementation of AdamW is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use the PyTorch implementation torch.optim.AdamW instead, or set `no_deprecation_warning=True` to disable this warning
