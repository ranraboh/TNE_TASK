### End-to-end NP enrichment model

Text-based NP enrichment is a task that aims at evaluating the relation between \
noun phrases in the text that can be expressed as a preposition. The repository contains implementation of \
an end-to-end architecture for evaluating the relation between NP span pairs. \
The model architecture incorporates effective novel techniques ranging from graph neural networks \
to a span encoding strategy which effectively captures information about the spans in the document.
